# rmath - reduced set of math functions

The set of functions which are provided in rmath.h and rmath.c expose a
very limited set of functions to do some mathematical computations with
matrices. This is only useful if you don't have a sophisticated math
library available or have available but can't use it. 

The purpose of this limited set of functions is not to compete with
other libraries but only to have some functions available where you
usually don't have them.

An example on how to use the functions is provided in form of an
implementation of the Markov Clustering for Graphs, short MCL. For more
information about MCL, visit [this link](http://micans.org/mcl/).
